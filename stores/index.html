            ### Desirable features of a peer-to-peer network

            - Scalable
              - No consensus on the state of the system, peers can change state without having all the other peers agree
            - Data availability
              - Resilient to network partitions
            - Consistency
              - Data never reaches an irreconcilable state
            - Resilient to bad actors
              - If some node is not behaving according to the rules of the game, they can be easily identified and protected against
            - Security and Privacy
